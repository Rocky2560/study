# ðŸ§  Learning Patterns & Solving Programming Challenges

Welcome to my project! This repository is dedicated to sharpening problem-solving skills through the exploration of **algorithmic patterns**, **data structures**, and **challenging programming problems**. The goal is to grow as a developer by understanding not just *what* works, but *why* it works.

## ðŸš€ About the Project

This project serves as a learning journal and a personal challenge. Each section contains:

- âœ… A well-explained solution to a programming problem
- ðŸ”„ Repeated patterns and strategies (e.g., sliding window, two pointers)
- ðŸ’¡ Reflections and notes on what was learned

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Algorithms
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Tree and Binary Search Tree Algorithms
- Hash Maps and Sets
- Stack & Queue-based Patterns
- Bit Manipulation
